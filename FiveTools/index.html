    <p>Trying to generate little infographics to demonstrate the five tools of each of 30 mlb teams.</p>
    <p>The five tools are speed, fielding, throwing, hitting for contact and hitting for power.</p>
    <p>In our case, we use as a proxy for speed a teams stolen base rate (SB/(SB+CS)); fielding percentage as a proxy for fielding ability; ERA as a proxy for throwing; batting average for contact skills; and slugging percentage for power.</p>
