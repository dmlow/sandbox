\section{Problem Statement}
A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is $9009 = 91 \times 99$.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

\section{notes}
First, observe that the product of two 3-digit numbers is less than $10^3 \times 10^3 = 10^6$, so it has at most 6 digits. Thus, the largest such product, $p$, has the form $abccba$, that is, 
\begin{eqnarray*}
p 
&=& 100001a + 10010b + 1100c \\
&=& 11(9091a + 910b + 100c) \\
&=& 11(9091 \cdot a + 2\cdot 5 \cdot 7 \cdot 13 \cdot b + 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 5 \cdot 5 \cdot c) \\
&=& mn
\end{eqnarray*}
where $m$ and $n$ are our three digit numbers.

At least one of $m$ and $n$ is divisible by $11$. By symmetry, assume $11$ divides $m$, so $m = 11 \cdot m'$, where $m'$ is a two digit number. That leaves us with a $899 \times 89$ matrix to examine ($80011$ potential matches).
